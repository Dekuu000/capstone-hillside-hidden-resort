# UI Rules (ui-ux-pro-max-skill)

- Mobile-first responsive layouts (320px and up)
- Consistent spacing scale (Tailwind)
- Clear states: loading, empty, error, success
- Forms: inline validation + disable submit while pending
- Tables: search, filter, pagination where relevant
- Buttons: consistent hierarchy (primary/secondary/destructive)
- Use shared components in src/components/ui (Button, Input, Select, Card, Badge, Modal)
- Do not change business logic to “fit UI”
